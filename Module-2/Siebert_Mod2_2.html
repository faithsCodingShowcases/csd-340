	<h1>Assignment 2.3 â€“ Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2 </h1>
	<h2>Who Am I In a Nut Shell?</h2>
	<p class="intro">Background: Hello I'm Faith Siebert. I live in Southwest Minnesota in the middle of no where. I come from a 
big blended family. I have 3 adopted sisters, one biological sister, two step sisters and one step brother. I have been with my current
boyfriend for around 5 years. We live together on an acarage. We live in the basment as the house is built like a house on top of 
a house so I enjoy the quiet. We have three dogs together: Murphy who is a King Charles Spaniel, Douglas who is a Boxer, and Leo who is a Golden Retrievor. 	</p>
	<p>Hobbies:  I enjoy a variety of activities in my spare time (less now that I work longer hours). I typically enjoy playing videogames,
	or chrocheting on my days off from school and work. During the summer we play with our dogs or go ride our side-by-side. We do do the
	typical partying or having friends over as well. I do do some coding on the side for my portfolio. I love coding websites for the creativity
	to let me shine through. </p>
	<p> Asparations: Right now I work in IT (finally got out of the nursing home) as a Automation and Security Support Specialtist. 
	My position will let me work two days in office and three days at home. This is my end goal as I love to have my own quiet space away from people.
	My end goal is to work as a database developer (simple easy with good pay). I would also consider being a python developer. Oviously working from home would 
be my end goal but I dont forsee that happening for quite a while.	</p>
	<p>Other life goals: I eventually want to be able to own a larger shop house with a larger piece of land. I want to be married with one kid
within the next 10 years. I also want to be able to pay off my student loans in half the time as normal people as my living situation right now 
is ideal. I want to be able to get a new car within a year as well. </p>
